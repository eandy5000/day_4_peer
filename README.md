#Exercise

##Redoing an old exercise with bootstrap gulp and jquery

What I want you to do for this challenge, is take the Three Bugs Challenge that you completed individually, then mesh it together with your seating partners code. Then, together, you are going to replace the DOM appending code that currently exists, with jQuery code that is much nicer and cleaner! Make sure to put each individual employee inside of their own Div Container. 

Then, append a button to each employee. Clicking on the button should simple console log out EVERY employee. Then, style up the whole experience with div that sit next to each other horizontally (not vertically as they default to!). 

##Hard Mode
You and your partner should do a little research into 'this', or more specifically '$(this)'. You should replace the console.log code that currently logs out all of the employees, to specifically console log out just the employee that was clicked!

##Pro Mode
Replace the console.log functionality with .remove(), but specifically remove the whole container, relative to the employee that was clicked.
